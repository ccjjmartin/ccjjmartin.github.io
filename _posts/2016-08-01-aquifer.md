Aquifer on Pantheon isn't a feature that works out of the box but it does work
and in this tutorial I will teach you how by covering:

1. Installing Aquifer
2. Creating a new Aquifer project
3. Preparing your project for Pantheon
4. Next steps

<!-- more -->

## Node

If you don't have `nvm` ([node version manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
installed, it is highly recommended.

## Installing Aquifer

The Aquifer documentation is officially hosted at:
[http://aquifer.io/](http://aquifer.io/)

If you are looking to just get Aquifer working the
[Quick Start Guide](http://docs.aquifer.io/sections/quickstart-guide.html) will
run you through the steps of getting Aquifer set up on your local environment.

WARNING: Until Aquifer releases a new version the version installed when
following the quick start guide will not work with the rest of this tutorial.

So, which version of Aquifer *does* work with this tutorial?

We will be using the Aquifer branch 1.0.0. This is the latest development
branch until we get a full 1.0.0 release.

#### Setting up a development version of Aquifer:

[This page](http://docs.aquifer.io/sections/installing-aquifer.html#installing-for-development)
contains a section called "Installing for development," this will be the set of
instructions we follow.

It basically says:

1. Run `node --version` to check that you are running node v6.3.1 or later. If
not, [use nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) to install a more recent
version.
2. If you had a version of Aquifer already installed, delete the `node_modules`
directory within the Aquifer directory.
3. If not, navigate to a directory you wish to install Aquifer in and clone the
repository:
  a. `git clone git@github.com:aquifer/aquifer.git` # SSH version **- or -**
  b. `git clone https://github.com/aquifer/aquifer.git` # HTTPS if no github keys
4. IMPORTANT: Checkout the 1.0.0 branch `git checkout 1.0.0`
5. Run `npm install` to get the latest packages.
6. Then run `npm link` to tell node that you have a command line package outside
of the normal node install directory. This will also create a symlink in your
`/usr/local/bin directory` and your `/usr/local/lib/node_modules` directory for
your new Aquifer command.
7. Verify your Aquifer version by running `aquifer --version` (This will return
1.0.0-beta1 but that is correct as of the time of writing this article).

If you made it this far without errors, congratulations, you are doing good!
You can now use this directory as a normal Git repository and can switch
branches and update Aquifer as the latest updates come out.

## Creating a new Aquifer project

Now we'll setup a new Aquifer project. You can use an existing Aquifer project but
for purposes of this demo we will use a new project.

1. Navigate to a directory you want to install your Aquifer project in.
2. Create a new project named "test": `aquifer create test`
3. Navigate into the project that was generated: `cd test`
4. Then, run `aquifer build` (This should complete without errors. If it doesn't,
your environment should be fixed at this stage before continuing).

## Preparing your project for Pantheon

#### Editing drupal.make.yml

BIG PICTURE: We are replacing the standard Drupal core with Pantheon's Drupal
core based on Pressflow. Without this step your site won't run on Pantheon.  
You can feel free to replace the reference to Pantheon's core with Acquia's
core, Pressflow, another hosting provider's core, or a distribution depending
upon your exact needs. This flexibility is one of the many benefits of using Aquifer.

1. Using your normal text editor open the `drupal.make.yml` file
2. It should say core 7.x

This:
{% highlight yaml %}
projects:
  drupal:
    version: ~
  admin_menu:
    version: ~
{% endhighlight %}

Should read:

{% highlight yaml %}
projects:
  # Core version 7.50.
  drops_7:
    type: "core"
    download:
      type: "git"
      url: "git@github.com:pantheon-systems/drops-7.git"
      branch: "master"
      revision: "2f1c945d01cd03250e2b6668ad77bf24f54a5a56"
  # Contrib
  admin_menu:
    version: ~
{% endhighlight %}

For your convenience, this is Acquia's configuration (UNTESTED):

{% highlight yaml %}
projects:
  # Core version 7.50.
  drupal:
    type: "core"
    download:
      type: "git"
      url: "git://git.acquia.com/drupal/branches/7.x.git"
      branch: "master"
      revision: "837b8d22cd084b5c15f93ef6b65a98d9d20ee80f"
  # Contrib
  admin_menu:
    version: ~
{% endhighlight %}

For your convenience, this is Pressflow's configuration (UNTESTED):

{% highlight yaml %}
projects:
  # Core version 7.44.
  drupal:
    type: "core"
    download:
      type: "git"
      url: "git@github.com:pressflow/7.git"
      branch: "master"
      revision: "c3d3e3b7c07ff19bdbf8eddbafb9340c489ee23c"
  # Contrib
  admin_menu:
    version: ~
{% endhighlight %}


Note: Change the revision to the commit SHA of any version. Then run:

{% highlight raw %}
aquifer build
{% endhighlight %}

If this succeeded and in your terminal output you see:

{% highlight raw %}
drops_7 cloned from git@github.com:pantheon-systems/drops-7.git.     [ok]
Checked out revision 2f1c945d01cd03250e2b6668ad77bf24f54a5a56.       [ok]
{% endhighlight %}

You now have a Pantheon ready project. Congratulations you just leveled
up!!!

You could build this to a separate directory and use this as an artifact repo
but why don't we upgrade you project one more time and make deployments easier?

#### Setting up Pantheon

If you have not already this would be a good time to create a FREE developer's
account on Pantheon. Also setup a new project and give it a name (we will need
that shortly). Don't worry too much about setup here, we are going to change
things soon.

#### Editing aquifer.json

BIG PICTURE: We are going to build the project and have it overwrite and commit
on the destination remote. Conceptually, a normal workflow for this ends up
creating two repositories: (1) Your aquifer repository (where all the source
code lives) and (2) your artifact repository (the built site with core, contrib,
files, etc, ready to run).

1. Using your normal text editor open the `aquifer.json` file
2. The part we want to focus on here is the extensions.

In a new project this reads:

{% highlight json %}
  "extensions": {},
{% endhighlight %}

We need to update this to add the aquifer-git extension:

{% highlight json %}
"extensions": {
  "aquifer-git": {
    "source": "aquifer/aquifer-git#1.0.0",
    "remote": "{copy and paste your git connection info from pantheon here}",
    "branch": "master"
  }
},
{% endhighlight %}

The code block above will deploy directly to Pantheon. If you would like to
deploy to GitHub first instead change the remote info to point to your GitHub
repository.

#### Additional details about the aquifer-git configuration:

On this line:

{% highlight raw %}
"source": "aquifer/aquifer-git#1.0.0",
{% endhighlight %}

We are specifically telling `aquifer` we want to use the 1.0.0 branch of the
`aquifer-git` extension which is the latest development version as of the
writing of this article.

On this line:

{% highlight raw %}
"remote": "{copy and paste your git connection info from Pantheon here}",
{% endhighlight %}

By doing this, you add the ability to deploy your Aquifer project to the specified Pantheon remote.
A Pantheon remote string should look something like this:

{% highlight raw %}
ssh://codeserver.dev.hash@codeserver.dev.hash.drush.in:2222/~/repository.git
{% endhighlight %}

But don't limit your imagination. The remote can be another directory on your
local machine, a github repository, or another remote host.

On this line:

{% highlight raw %}
"branch": "master"
{% endhighlight %}

We specify that aquifer-git will default to using the master branch.

NOTE: On Acquia you may need to set (SUPER UNTESTED - YOU SHOULD RESEARCH):

{% highlight raw %}
"folder": "docroot",
{% endhighlight %}

For additional information on configuring aquifer-git see the README:
[here](https://github.com/aquifer/aquifer-git/tree/1.0.0)

You now need to run `aquifer extensions-load` to download and install the
two new extensions.

Once the extensions have loaded, you are ready to start deploying. Make sure
your ssh keys are setup and type:

{% highlight raw %}
aquifer deploy-git
{% endhighlight %}

If this command succeeds then you now have a working Aquifer project on
Pantheon. If you didn't deploy straight to Pantheon you will have some
additional configuration here.

## Next steps

#### Setup your database

If you haven't already this would be a good time to setup your database.

#### Transfer your files

If you haven't already this would be a good time to transfer your files.

#### Editing settings.php

**OPTIONAL - EVERYTHING FROM HERE IS UNTESTED CODE IN DEMO**
- You may wish to separate out your Pantheon configuration in a separate
settings.php file named `pantheon.settings.php`.  If so, you will need to add
the following to your `aquifer.json` file:

{% highlight json %}
"settings/pantheon.settings.php": {
  "destination": "sites/default/pantheon.settings.php",
  "method": "symlink",
  "conflict": "overwrite"
},
{% endhighlight %}

- If you choose to implement a new file for Pantheon settings then you will
need to alter your `settings.php` file to include the following right before your
normal last code block implementing `local.settings.php`:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
// All Pantheon Environments.
if (defined('PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT')) {
  include DRUPAL_ROOT . '/sites/default/pantheon.settings.php';
}
else {
  // We are not on a pantheon environment. This is for local.
}
{% endhighlight %}

- In your master module configuration you may wish to include pantheon specific
modules like `pantheon_apachesolr` for dev, test, and live.

#### Congratulations

If you made it here you rock!
