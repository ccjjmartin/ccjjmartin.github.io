Ever struggled with your computer trying to do something basic? I know I have,
to think of all the wasted hours trying to compile SASS, google searching weird
errors on the command line, and just getting MySQL to run.

My countless hours don't have to be your countless hours. Give up your evil
non-committing ways, let go of FileZilla, stop running mysql on your local
machine. Don't run a public server at your house! It will all result in pain and
agony.

If I can make the transition from doing everything the old school (hard) way to
the using the latest technology SO CAN YOU!

After working with a bunch of great co-workers at Four Kitchens who were willing
 to share their knowledge with me, I have learned a lot. This talk will be a
 guided discussion of the tools I use now and why I use them. This will be in
 more of a round table format with everyones input valued equally.

BONUS: I setup a new computer recently and documented the commands to set the
tools up.
