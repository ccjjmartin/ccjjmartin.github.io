So you got hit with an iCal invite for 19.99 RayBans?  Here is how to get rid of
it the right way without notifying the spammers you have a valid email:

<!-- more -->

1. Open iCal

2. Create a new calendar called Trash

3. Double click the spam calendar invites
  - NOTE: Do not accept or decline, it notifies the spammers you have a valid
  email and you will receive even more invites in the future

4. Change the spam calendar invites to be associated with the new Trash calendar

5. Delete the new calendar to completely remove the invites

6. Select the delete and do not notify option
