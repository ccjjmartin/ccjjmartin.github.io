# Christopher Martin

Chris is a Junior Engineer specializing in support and maintenance of
Drupal-based sites. He loves learning how systems work and gaining a deeper
understanding of anything related to technology. This is best demonstrated by
his hobby of drone-making and robot-building.

Chris is the proud father of a beautiful daughter named Kiki. He has traveled to
China where he met his wife’s family. Austin, Texas is where he grew up and the
place he calls home.

Chris is also a member of local organizations including the Austin Drupal Dojo,
CapMac Users Group, ATX Hackerspace (a local inventor’s workshop), and the
Austin Chapter of Texas CPAs. Technology has been a very important part of his
life since age three when he first learned how to program on an Apple II with
floppy disks and a green screen.

He obtained a Bachelor’s in Accounting and a Master’s in Finance at Texas A&M
University. Prior to joining Four Kitchens, he worked for public accounting
firms, medical companies, and during one summer in college he was a custodian at
Walt Disney World.

Avatar, this is the real place that inspired the movie.
